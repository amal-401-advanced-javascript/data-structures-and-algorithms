# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
  - Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

# Challenge
  - Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

# Approach & Efficiency
  - I used a function that accept a two arrays and return a set of values found in both trees.

# Big O 
  - O(n) - Adding items into an array
  - O(1) - Comparing the arrays
