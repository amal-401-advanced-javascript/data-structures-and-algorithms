# Singly Linked List
  -  way to store a collection of elements. Like an array these can be character or integers. Each element in a linked list is stored in the form of a node.

## Challenge
- create two classes named node and singlylinkedlist which has a constructor and 3 methodes:
  - 1. insert(value), adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  - 2. includes(value), returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  - 3. toString(),returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List

## Approach & Efficiency
- insert O(1)
- includes O(n^2)
- toString O(n)
