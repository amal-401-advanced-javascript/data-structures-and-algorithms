  - In this repos I try to challenge my self and do my best to solve these challenges, you can see a lot of topics and you can find many way to solve each challenge.

## [Array-Reverse](./challenges/arrayReverse/array-reverse.js)
   - write function that reverse an array, don't use a built-in method.
## [Array-Shift](./challenges/arrayShift/array-shift.js)
   - write function that return new array, it add a number in the middle of the array.
## [Array-binary](./challenges/arrayBinarySearch/array-binary-search.js)
   - write function that search for number then return the index of that number , if the number does not exist return -1.
## [Singly-linked-list](./challenges/Data-Structure/linkedList/linked-list.js)
   - write a singly linked list that have three method(insert,includes,toString), to add,search and return all node in liked list.
## [Linked list insertions](./challenges/Data-Structure/linkedList/linked-list.js)
   - use some built-in function in the linked list such as (.append(value), .insertBefore(value, newVal), .insertAfter(value, newVal))
## [k-th value from the end of a linked list](./challenges/Data-Structure/linkedList/linked-list.js)
  - Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. 

## [Merge two linked lists](./challenges/Data-Structure/llMerge/ll-merge.js)

## [Stacks and Queues](./challenges/Data-Structure/stacksAndQueues/stacks-and-queues.js)
  - write class Node, class Stack with their common terminology(push, pop, peek, isEmpty) and class Queue with their common terminology(enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty).

## [ Queue with Stack ](./challenges/Data-Structure/queueWithStacks/queue-with-stacks.js)
  - Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## [ Multi-bracket Validation ](./challenges/multiBracketValidation/multi-bracket-validation.js)
  - Multi-bracket Validation .

## [ fifoAnimalShelter ](../challenges/Data-Structures/fifoAnimalShelter/fifo-animal-shelter.js )
  - First-in, First out Animal Shelter.

## [  Tree ](./challenges/Data-Structure/tree/tree.js)
  -  Binary Tree and BST Implementation

## [ fizzbuzz Tree ](./challenges/Data-Structure/fizzBuzzTree/fizz-buzz-tree.js)
  -  Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value
